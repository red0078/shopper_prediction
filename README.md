# shopper_prediction
The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 (online) sessions. The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.  Of the 12,330 sessions in the dataset, 84.5% (10,422) were negative class samples that did not end with shopping, and the rest (1908) were positive class samples ending with shopping.  The 'Revenue' attribute will be my target values for this machine learning project. The project should be able to predict whether an online shopper (web user) will purchase a product from an online store, thus it is a classification problem.
